# Dynamic HR Module Routing & State Integration: Solution Summary

## 1. Dynamic Routing for Plugged-in HR Module Pages

### Goal
Enable the HR module to be “plugged in” to the main app, so all HR pages (routes) are automatically prefixed (e.g., `/hr/myapp/...`) without repeating the prefix everywhere in our code.

### How We Solved It

**Step 1: Centralize the HR Route Prefix**
- We use an environment variable (e.g., `NEXT_PUBLIC_HR_MODULE_PATH`) to define the HR module’s base path.

**Step 2: Utility for Path Building**
- We created a `buildHrPath` utility function that prepends the HR base path to any route, but only if it’s not already present.
- This prevents double prefixes like `/hr/myapp/hr/myapp/login`.

**Before:**
```tsx
// Sidebar or navigation links (manual prefixing everywhere)
<Link href="/hr/myapp/login">Login</Link>
<Link href="/hr/myapp/dashboard">Dashboard</Link>
```

**After:**
```tsx
// Use HrLink everywhere, no manual prefixing
<HrLink href="/login">Login</HrLink>
<HrLink href="/dashboard">Dashboard</HrLink>
```

**buildHrPath.ts**
```ts
export function buildHrPath(path: string) {
  const base = process.env.NEXT_PUBLIC_HR_MODULE_PATH || '/hr/myapp';
  if (path.startsWith(base)) return path;
  return `${base}${path.startsWith('/') ? '' : '/'}${path}`;
}
```

**Step 3: Custom Link and Router**
- We created a custom `HrLink` component and a `useHrRouter` hook.
- These wrappers automatically use `buildHrPath` so we can write:
  ```tsx
  <HrLink href="/login">Login</HrLink>
  router.push("/dashboard")
  ```
  and always get the correct, prefixed route.

**HrLink.tsx**
```tsx
import Link from 'next/link';
import { buildHrPath } from '../lib/buildHrPath';
export function HrLink({ href, ...props }) {
  return <Link href={buildHrPath(href)} {...props} />;
}
```

**useHrRouter.ts**
```ts
import { useRouter } from 'next/navigation';
import { buildHrPath } from './buildHrPath';
export function useHrRouter() {
  const router = useRouter();
  return {
    ...router,
    push: (path: string) => router.push(buildHrPath(path)),
    // ...other router methods as needed
  };
}
```

**Step 4: Refactor Usage**
- We updated sidebar and navigation to use `HrLink` and `useHrRouter`, so all navigation in the HR module is automatically routed with the correct prefix.

**Before:**
```tsx
<Link href="/hr/myapp/employees">Employees</Link>
```
**After:**
```tsx
<HrLink href="/employees">Employees</HrLink>
```

**Emphasis:**
We no longer have to manually add the HR prefix in our code—just use the custom link/hook.

## 2. Dynamically Adding the HR Module and Injecting Its Reducers

### Goal
Allow the HR module to be loaded dynamically and have its Redux state (reducers) injected into the main app’s Redux store at runtime, so HR state is available everywhere.

### How We Solved It

**Step 1: Reducer Manager**
- We implemented a `reducerManager` utility that allows us to add (and remove) reducers at runtime.
- The manager always starts with our static/core reducers (like `auth`, `miscellaneous`), so the reducer map is never empty or invalid.

**reducerManager.ts**
```ts
export function createReducerManager(initialReducers) {
  let reducers = { ...initialReducers };
  let combinedReducer = combineReducers(reducers);
  return {
    getReducerMap: () => reducers,
    reduce: (state, action) => combinedReducer(state, action),
    add: (key, reducer) => {
      if (!reducers[key]) {
        reducers[key] = reducer;
        combinedReducer = combineReducers(reducers);
      }
    },
    // ...remove, etc.
  };
}
```

**Step 2: Store Setup**
- We set up the Redux store so that the reducer manager’s `reduce` function is passed to `persistReducer`.
- This allows both static and dynamically injected reducers to be persisted and available at the top level of our Redux state.

**Before:**
```ts
const store = configureStore({
  reducer: persistReducer(persistConfig, rootReducer),
  // ...
});
```
**After:**
```ts
const reducerManager = createReducerManager(rootReducer);
const store = configureStore({
  reducer: persistReducer(persistConfig, reducerManager.reduce),
  // ...
});
(store as any).reducerManager = reducerManager;
```

**Step 3: HR Reducer Injection**
- In the HR module’s layout (or entry point), we inject the HR reducers at runtime:
  ```ts
  import { hrReducers } from './store/hrReducers';
  import { store } from '../../store';
  Object.entries(hrReducers).forEach(([key, reducer]) => {
    (store as any).reducerManager.add(key, reducer);
  });
  ```
- This makes the HR state available in the main store as soon as the HR module is loaded.

**Step 4: Safe Selectors and State Access**
- We updated selectors to use optional chaining and fallback values, so the app never crashes if a reducer is missing or not yet injected.

**Before:**
```ts
export const selectUser = (state) => state.auth.user;
```
**After:**
```ts
export const selectUser = (state) => state.auth?.user ?? null;
```

**Emphasis:**
This approach allows us to plug in (or remove) feature modules like HR at runtime, and their state will be seamlessly integrated into our main Redux store.

| Issue | Solution Steps |
|-------|---------------|
| **Dynamic HR Routing** | 1. Centralized HR base path<br>2. Utility for path building<br>3. Custom Link/Router<br>4. Refactored navigation to use them |
| **Dynamic HR State Injection** | 1. Reducer manager for runtime injection<br>2. Store setup with reducer manager<br>3. Inject HR reducers in HR layout<br>4. Safe selectors for robust state access |

**Key Takeaways:**
- We now have a scalable, maintainable way to plug in feature modules (like HR) with both dynamic routing and dynamic state.
- All navigation and state management for the HR module is handled automatically, with no risk of route or state conflicts.
